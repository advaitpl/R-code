ibrary(alr4);  data("Highway")

and the description of the variables may be obtained through the command help(Highway). The requisite R code for obtaining the ivif is given below.

lograte = log(Highway$rate)

lmrate = lm(lograte~adt+len+trks+lane+acpt+sigs+itg+slim+lwid+shld,data=Highway)

library(lmreg);  ivif(lmrate)
##The resulting IVIFs are greater than 100 for the intercept (1005.9), slim (338.1) and lwid (911.4).
